n5-innsyn

This is an early alpha version of a Noark 5 viewer. It is a REST service that returns JSON.

This is a maven project, developed on Linux under Eclipse. To run the code you need to follow the following steps:

1. Set up database

Uses mysql. Under src/main/resources/config.properties file and here you can edit the details for the database username and password.
The current default username is 'n5' and default password is 'n5pass'. You can change these or run the following commands in mysql
to create the necessary objects.

create database if not exists noark5;
grant all privileges on noark5.* to n5@localhost identified by 'n5pass';

2. Run program

Locate the directory that has pom.xml and run the following
mvn clean
mvn spring-boot:run


3. Check browser
Open your borswer and type in the following address:

http://localhost:9000/login

You can logon using admin:password and then check the following.

http://localhost:9000/fonds

You will not find any data in the database, there is another tool called noark-5-validator that
you can use to import a Noark 5 extraction with. A lot of the data model for n5v3.1 is in place. 
The rest will be added (the complete n5v3.1 datamodel has already been implemented in the 
noark-5-validator tool). We will add an SQL file that creates some data in the coming days
